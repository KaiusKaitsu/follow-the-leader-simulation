Finally, the first proper commit, includes most of the classes and objects of the program.
Working sketch for the GUI. Next will be objects simulation and simulationDraw.
With working GUI it will be easier to implement and test the simulants and their physics.

Only thing that has been tested is the mock gui (It "works")
workload till this point has been around 5 hours (not including the planing phase)
I'm knowingly lagging behind the plan for now, but I have completed other courses exercises to have this week solely for this project.

Big changes. Testing out the merging of simulation and UserInterface.
Since all the logic is operated by individual simulants there is really not too much use for a dedicated simulation object.
Leader and followers are now both Simulants and they are differed by the constructor isLeader: boolean.

Testing file added but ScalaTest isn't working too well so the Vector2D test isnt working anymore. But the logic holds. Test for the simulationDraw also exists.

Some difficulties have been coming up with the complexity of the program growing. This is why steps torwards simplifying the dependencies between objects have been made. 

during the week 6.3 - 13.3 work load was around 15 hours and last week no progress was made since I was doing other exercises in advance to dedicate this week once again for 
the project. In terms of scheduale im roughly in phase.

Plan is to have a working simulation by 3.4, not perfect but debuggable.
