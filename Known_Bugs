Bug #1: Simulant may get stuck in the upper left hand corner. --mostly fixed following simulant movement logic updates
Bug #2: Resizing the window breaks the visuals. -- fixed after making the window not resizable
Bug #3: Leader may get stuck orbiting a target point -- fixed with extra logic to simulant class "update()" value assingment "newMomentum"
Bug #4: Adjusting the sliders created with 'createSlider' class will drop the fps to half. 
  Prob fixable with threads or making so it updates when user isnt holding the slider but kinda low prio atm
Bug #5: GUI is lagging as in seemingly poor fps when the simulation is idle.  -- Fixed. replaced Thread.sleep with areaPanel.repaint in timer listener
Bug #6: GUI moves when feedback texts length varies
